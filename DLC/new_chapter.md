## The Valkyrie

<cite>
  "When a warrior has proven her devotion to Athulua through her brave deeds and exceptional 
  skill in battle, the Goddess shows her favor by granting a spiritual emissary to aid the Amazon.
  These emissaries of Athulua are called Valkyrie, and they are the spirits of the greatest heroes
  from the Amazon people. The power to summon a Valkyrie is the greatest honor that an Amazon
  warrior can receive. It is believed this gift is a sign that your place beside the Goddess
  is assured when you pass from this world-perhaps even as a Valkyrie."
</cite>

## New, Improved !

Since <em class="v">patch 1.10</em> the Valkyrie can use *Critical Strike*, *Dodge*, *Avoid*, and *Evade*. In fact she gains those
skills from your Amazon, meaning all the points you spend in those skills will work for the Valkyrie.

The mana cost has been reduced to about 40 percent of what it was in <em class="v">v1.09</em>. A level 20 Valkyrie now costs 43 mana instead of 101.

The Valkyrie gains different pieces of <span class="rare">Rare</span> and <span class="magic">Magic</span> equipment based on her skill level.
The items come with random bonuses, so every time you cast the Valkyrie the bonuses on her items will be randomly chosen.

The Valkyrie can appear in different colors, depending on what bonuses were spawned on her armor.

## Armor Color
