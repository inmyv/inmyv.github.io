## "The Tankazon Resource" - A Diablo II mini site

A resource for Diablo 2 players.

See live site at https://fabd.github.io/diablo2

There are two very handy resources I created by extracting the game data and running some Perl scripts:

- **Bonuses** : a simple page that sorts all Diablo 2 items, runes and runewords by their magical properties.
- **Runewizard** : an interactive page (javascript) which remembers which runes you have found, and lets you see easily all the Runewords that can be completed, as well as the Runewords properties.

## New Runewizard repo!

As of April 2021, **Runewizard** now has its own separate repository at : [github.com/fabd/diablo2-runewizard](https://github.com/fabd/diablo2-runewizard).

The [live version](https://fabd.github.io/diablo2-runewizard/) is also hosted by Github Pages from this newer repository.

## History

I created a mini-site called "The Tankazon Resource" in 2003. Back then I was teaching myself HTML and Javascript. Since the gameplay data from Diablo 2 could be extracted as simple tabular data (ie. spreadsheets) it provided a fun environment to experiment and learn scripting with Perl.

The site was intended to be a collection of data that I often wanted to look up when playing the game. Specifically: weapon speeds and IAS (Increased Attack Speed) breakpoints for the Amazon, Experience of each area in the game, Level and Location of all the "Super Unique" monsters that can be hunted for loot.

This resource was shared on "The Amazon Basin" community, at the time the data was relevant for the 1.10 patch. When I stopped playing the game I didn't know anything about web hosting back then, and someone called "marduke" offered to host the pages. The pages were available on his site for a couple years or so (according to the "Wayback Machine Internet Archive").

In early 2014 I started playing the game again. I found an old backup and thought it would be a fun little project to learn Github pages, and make this resource available again.

It's amazing to think that Diablo 2 patch 1.10 came out 10 years ago! The game is still very much fun to play and moreso these days as you can share those experiences on Twitch :)
