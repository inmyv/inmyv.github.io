## New, Improved !

Since <em class="v">patch 1.10</em> the Valkyrie can use *Critical Strike*, *Dodge*, *Avoid*, and *Evade*. In fact she gains those
skills from your Amazon, meaning all the points you spend in those skills will work for the Valkyrie.

The mana cost has been reduced to about 40 percent of what it was in <em class="v">v1.09</em>. A level 20 Valkyrie now costs 43 mana instead of 101.

The Valkyrie gains different pieces of <span class="rare">Rare</span> and <span class="magic">Magic</span> equipment based on her skill level.
The items come with random bonuses, so every time you cast the Valkyrie the bonuses on her items will be randomly chosen.

The Valkyrie can appear in different colors, depending on what bonuses were spawned on her armor.
